<br/>

A ***Step-by-Step Example*** of using an **HTML Form** to send a "Contact Us" Message via Email without a Backend Server using a Google Script - No PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, Node.js etc.

See a working example here: https://dwyl.github.io/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server/

**_Note:_** With EU's GDPR, we strongly advise [researching recommendations on user privacy;](https://cloud.google.com/privacy/gdpr) you may be held _responsible_ for the safekeeping of users' personal data and should provide them a way to contact you.

**_Warning:_** Google's API has limits on how many emails it can send in a day.
This may vary on your Google account, see [the limits here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas).
We recommend implementing this tutorial through Part 3, since the data will
always be added to the spreadsheet first, then emailed if possible.

## Why?

We needed a way of sending an email from a "*static*" HTML page
when you don't (*want* to) *have* a *server*.

### *Key Advantages*

+ No "*Backend*" to Deploy/Maintain/Pay for
+ ***Fully Customisable*** - every aspect is customisable!
+ Email *sent via* ***Google Mail*** which is ***Whitelisted Everywhere*** (*high deliverability success*)
+ **Collect/Store** any **form data** in a ***Spreadsheet*** for easy viewing
(*perfect if you need to share it with non-technical people*)

## What?

Instead of using a server to send your email,
which is *easy* but requires *maintenance*,
use Google to send mail on your behalf
and use Google Spreadsheets to keep track of the data!

> You *could* use a "*free*" service like https://formspree.io/ to process your form submissions
if you don't care where you are sending your data and want to manage the data submitted
in your email inbox (*messy ... yuck*!)
*Or*... you can *invest* a few minutes and keep data private/manageable.
*Take your pick*.

## *How*?

### 1. Make a Copy of the Sample Spreadsheet

> Sample: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bn4m6iA_Xch1zzhNvo_6CoQWqOAgwwkOWJKC-phHx2Q/copy

Sign in to your Google account and click on "**Make a copy**..."

![1-make-copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1406149/29245471-feb7b034-7f97-11e7-9c0d-f06238e8362b.png)

This should give you something like this:

![2-copy-of-sheet](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10559710/3aec92f0-74ef-11e5-9295-f1988a23257b.png)

> Note: Feel free to change the name of the Copy to anything you want,
it will not affect the outcome.

### 2. Open the Script Editor

Open the **Apps Script editor** by clicking "**Extensions**" > "**Apps Script**"

![2 script-editor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1406149/148702005-00f3b846-d6a7-4e3a-9d92-c255a7233b46.png)

Here's a *snapshot* of the script you need (*at this point in the exercise*): [google-script-just-email.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server/1d1c6727f69dec64a6b7f6bd6ff0dd72d0374210/google-script-just-email.js)

### 3. Set the `TO_ADDRESS` in the Script

**_Warning:_** If you do not uncomment and set your email as the value of
`TO_ADDRESS`, it is possible for someone who has web skills to alter your form
and send emailed data to an arbitrary email address.

This risk may not be very likely. Instead, if you wish, you can leave this
variable commented out if you accept this possible risk but want the added
convenience of setting this email variable inside your HTML form as a
`data-email` attribute. This allows you to easily change where to send emails
inside your HTML form without going back through steps 2-6. This functionality
does **require** you to use the provided JS file in Part Two, Step 10.

If you do not want to accept that potential risk, please uncomment the code for
the variable `TO_ADDRESS`, and set this value equal to the email which should
receive the form's data when submitted.

![3-script-editor-showing-script](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560379/9efa5b3a-7501-11e5-96ba-a9e3b2d77ee4.png)

### 4. Save changes to your Script

After making any code changes, you must first save them in the editor using the save icon.

![4-apps-script-save-code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1406149/148702006-bd16b31b-fca1-494a-ba46-502d52545128.png)

### 5. Publish the *Updated* Script as a Web App

![5-1-publish-button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1406149/148702007-8ec6047c-804b-492c-bc00-a9b59e515914.png)

:warning: Note: You *must* select the `Anyone` option for the 'Who has access' dropdown or form responses will not go through! :warning:

![5-2-deploy-new-version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1406149/148702008-3d5e1b29-2670-4205-95fa-bfcb3ae2522b.png)

### 6. Authorize the Script to Send Emails

![6-1-auth-required](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1406149/148702009-ae03cbfe-0e1d-4eed-af6d-e32befe55d17.png)

Unless you [verify your script with Google](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/client-verification#requesting_verification), you will need to click on "Advanced" and "Go to ... (unsafe)" to give this app permissions.

![6-2-auth-failed-verification](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1406149/44312495-79583780-a3b6-11e8-9740-8c9b50f195d6.png)

![6-3-allow-sending-emails](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1406149/148702010-e7b10721-2dd5-43b7-94f2-4e0e59397a57.png)

Copy the web app URL to your clip board / note pad.
Then Click "OK".

![6-4-deploy-as-web-app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1406149/148702011-95587469-bec5-4d5a-9ddf-18ed0043bced.png)


### 7. Create your *basic* HTML Form

Using the template in `index.html` in this repo,
create your own html file with the basic form. (*save the file*)

:warning: If you're already trying to use *your own form* by this step rather than the example one in this repo:
+ Each of your form elements must have a `name` attribute equal to that of your column name in the Google sheet
+ The form's `class` must be `gform`, i.e. `<form class="gform">`
  + If you want to alter this later, you will need to create your
  own version of `form-submission-handler.js` and amend the expected `class`


> Remember to change the Form `action` URL to the one you copied in
the previous step:

![7-html-form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1406149/44312329-9b9c8600-a3b3-11e8-9816-4bdbbc96dc62.png)


### 8. Open the HTML Form (*page*) in your Browser

Fill in some sample data in the HTML Form:

![html form](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560494/674b64c4-7504-11e5-801a-b537d276f671.png)

Submit the form. You should see a confirmation that it was sent:
![form sent](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560501/8f605dd4-7504-11e5-8cd7-06d768beba4d.png)

### 9. Check the email inbox for the address you set

Open the inbox for the email address you set in **Step 3** (*above*)

![email received](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560512/f87f1652-7504-11e5-8b0f-c342c395a193.png)


> ***Done***. That's it. You just created an HTML form that sends email!

# *Part Two - Make It Look Good* ...

We are going to keep this ***Super Lean*** by using [**PURE CSS**](https://purecss.io/start/)
for our Style (*fix the "ugly" HTML Form in step 8*).
And `submit` the form using [**JQuery** "***AJAX***"](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) to keep the person
on your page/site (*avoid "ugly" response page*)

### 10. Submit the Form using **JavaScript** "***AJAX***"

To *prevent* the page from changing to the `JSON` response/result
we need to submit the form using ***AJAX***.

Download [the following Javascript file](form-submission-handler.js) and update your `index.html` to point to it at the *end* of your file
(*before the closing `</body>` tag)

```html
<script data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript" src="form-submission-handler.js"></script>
```

**Warning:** If you did not set the `TO_ADDRESS` variable in Step 3, then
you need to include a `data-email="example@email.net"` attribute inside the
main form element. See the example form for more details. Otherwise, if you did
set this variable, then you do not need this form attribute.

This keeps the person on the same page. No refresh. Next step is making a thank you message appear.

### 11. Add a customised Thank You Message Shown when Form Submitted

After following step 10, you can choose to add a thank you message after submitting. Add the following code between the `<form>` and `</form>` tags:

```html
<div style="display:none" class="thankyou_message">
 <!-- You can customize the thankyou message by editing the code below -->
 <h2><em>Thanks</em> for contacting us! We will get back to you soon!
 </h2>
</div>
```

This will now display a "Thank You" *message* when the form is submitted:

![thankyou message](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10561147/4086a89a-7517-11e5-840d-7f490353e225.png)

Tailor your message by editing the `thankyou_message` div.

### 12. Use CSS to Make the Form *Look Good*

For `this` *example* we are using ***Pure CSS***: https://purecss.io/start/
because its ***light weight*** (***4.0KB minified and gzipped***)
and *solves* our current "*problem*": Making it Look Good.

![PureCSS-Logo-Intro](https://github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/194400/10565838/72d6d52a-75d2-11e5-9b92-ca02b1124920.png)

![PureCSS-module-sizes](https://github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/194400/10565844/8f4885a0-75d2-11e5-9490-e3fc42c32616.png)

Without spending *too much* time on this, we can make the form *look*
***a lot*** nicer:

![contact form with pure css](https://github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/194400/10566392/f38bc454-75dd-11e5-85dd-6819494a98f2.png)

### 13. Make the email look good too!

By default, the sent email's body contains the key-value pairs from the form, with the key as an `<h4>` and the value as a `<div>`. This is a fairly basic, and foolproof view for the data.

You should get something that looks roughly like:
![Nicely formatted email](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5610747/22168070/335ad734-df62-11e6-9523-6e193e94151f.png)

> Bear in mind that this is a work in progress and does potentially open you up to getting more than you bargained for in the email. Because the email content is now looping over all the data sent in the form, if a robot or malicious user decides to `POST` more than you've asked for, you'll likely get it in your inbox. Use with caution for now. We're investigating improvements.

You can modify this though, via the script editor. The line:

```javascript
result += "<h4 style='text-transform: capitalize; margin-bottom: 0'>" + key + "</h4><div>" + obj[key] + "</div>";
```

has all you need. You can adjust the markup to suit you. We chose an `<h4>` because it was the best size for the email, and added the small amount of CSS to it to fix the capitalisation (the keys are all lower case in the JS object) and a bit of default spacing. While inline styles like this are generally bad practice on normal web pages, for email HTML they're about the only reliable way to do CSS!
We went with a `<div>` for the value part, because it could be anything - single-line, multiline (a `<p>` for example wouldn't cut it).

While we're here, there's also a `replyTo` option for the `sendEmail()` method which is commented out by default:

```javascript
MailApp.sendEmail({
  to: TO_ADDRESS,
  subject: "Contact form submitted",
  // replyTo: String(mailData.email), // This is optional and reliant on your form actually collecting a field named `email`
  htmlBody: formatMailBody(mailData)
});
```

You can uncomment that if you want to add a reply-to field to your email. The example in the script will set the reply-to as the email submitted in the form.

Google's documentation provides more information about MailApp.sendEmail (for example `cc`/`bcc` etc.) if you're interested:
https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/mail/mail-app

# *Part Three - Store Submitted Contact Form Data in a Spreadsheet*

Sending the form data directly to your email inbox is a *good*
first step, but we can do better. Also, as noted above, Google
has limits on how many emails you can send in a day, so storing
the data into a spreadsheet is safer and less prone to data loss.

### 14. Add the `record_data` Function to your Google Apps Script

![record_data example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10581613/8b4f9ad4-767b-11e5-90cc-962a9d6acc91.png)

This will record the data received from the `POST` as a *row* in the spreadsheet.
See: [**google-apps-script.js**](google-apps-script.js) for the full code you can *copy-paste*.

### 15. Save a New Version and Re-Publish it

Follow Steps 4, 5 & 6 to save a new version and ***re-publish*** the script.

### 16. Re-Test Submitting the Form

![submit the form](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10582654/cf3081e6-7680-11e5-9fd1-b989a8ba0b65.png)

### 17 Confirm the Data was Inserted into the Spreadsheet

![17-confirm-data-inserted](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10582676/eb8af5d8-7680-11e5-92bb-30dd08d2d7b3.png)


### _Live_ Server (_on your `localhost`_)

Because we are loading external **.js** files, our web browser
will not _allow_ us to simply open the **index.html** from a
local directory for testing out the form.

Open your terminal and run this command
to _**install** the **node modules** and **start** the **live server**_:

```sh
npm install live-server --save-dev && node_modules/.bin/live-server --port=8000
```

It will take a minute to install,
but once that's done your `live-server` will start up.

That starts a node.js HTTP server on port 8000
and opens the form you just created in your default browser.
If you wish to update the form styles in **style.css** or the
client-side Javascript in **form-submission-handler.js**,
please be sure to edit **index.html** to load those resources
locally rather than via GitHub.

> **Note**: This is a _light_ taste of Node.js for absolute beginners.
You do **not** need node.js to "deploy" this form,
you can run it on an **_any_ web server** that serves HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
If you have never used Node.js before, see: http://nodeguide.com/beginner.html
but for the purposes of this exercise (_submitting a form **without** a server_)
you _don't **need**_ node.js or `live-server`
it's just a _nice_ thing to have when you are creating
your form because it automatically re-loads the page when you make changes in your text editor!

If you want us to take this tutorial further, [***please let us know***!](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server/issues)

For your convenience, we have hosted a working demo of the field on GitHub
Pages, check it out to see the code and how it works:
https://dwyl.github.io/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server/


## Add your own fields!

In response to [Henry Beary's request](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server/issues/9)
we made the form handler *generic* which means you can now add any fields you want to the form.

We also created a form, `test.html`, which uses all kinds of form input elements
so you can just copy and paste elements as desired into your own form. Just be
sure to update their names and IDs. You can find a working example of this test
form here:
https://dwyl.github.io/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server/test.html

Remember to include the fields *inside* the form that has the class `gform`
and ensure that the `name` of the form element matches the new column heading in your spreadsheet.
e.g:
```HTML
<fieldset class="pure-group">
  <label for="color">Favourite Color: </label>
  <input id="color" name="color" placeholder="green" />
</fieldset>
```
This will allow you to capture the person's favourite color:
e.g:
![new-field-contains-data](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/11547132/9f162f6a-9949-11e5-89ac-aeb91e025844.png)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)

1. _How can I get help using this tutorial?_

- Feel free to [post an issue](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server/issues/new) describing in detail which steps you have gone through and what isn't working. To get a helpful response, please provide a [working example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) that reproduces your issue. For example, see [this sample CodePen](https://codepen.io/mckennapsean/pen/gdYzNY).

2. _Can I get edit access to the example spreadsheet?_

- No. This is being used to show a working example for anyone to copy, and an editable version could be broken accidentally, or maliciously, by any user.

3. _Why is the webpage forwarding to a bunch of text when I hit submit?_

- You are not properly loading the required Javascript which submits the data via AJAX, or your browser does not support AJAX. Please see Part 2 and check your console logs in case you are finding errors.

4. _Why is the webpage not successfully submitting the form?_

- Check your Javascript console logs. There could be an error while reading in the Javascript we have provided. There could be errors while submitting the form. It is required that your form have a class of `gform`, and also a `data-email` attribute if you have not set the `TO_ADDRESS` variable inside the Google Script file. Furthermore, the provided Javascript code also expects to see an email form element which it uses to check, a warning message for that element when an improper email is submitted, and then a `thank-you` div as well, which is shown after a form is successfully submitted. Please ensure that all of these HTML elements are in your form. See the sample file for code you can copy and paste. When you have all of these elements and a proper form set up, you should not see any error messages in your Javascript console when you hit submit.

5. _The webpage is saying my data was submitted, but why isn't my data being saved or sent to me?_

- When you copied the spreadsheet and published the Google Script, did you set the permissions to "Anyone, even Anonymous"? This is required for the form to work, since anyone on the internet can hit send to give you their data. Be sure that you have deployed the proper version of the script and used "Manage versions..." when making changes.

6. _How do I change the emails this script sends?_

- You can tweak the Google Script on the server to send emails to anyone and in whatever format you wish. This could be used to send a confirmation email to those contacting you, but we have not added this feature to this tutorial to avoid potential spamming. The sender of the email will always be the Google account you use to create the form/script, however. Further details on how to customize the email can be found in [the `MailApp` API](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/mail/mail-app). You can instead use [the `GmailApp` API](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/gmail/) which may be more flexible for certain use-cases.


7. _Is this secure? Can I use it for sensitive data?_

- No. While data that is sent over POST may be more protected, the information could easily be intercepted by a third party or middleman, and Google has complete access to the data inside a Google Spreadsheet. Email is also not a very secure communication medium by default. We would recommend you invest in a secure platform and server for storing your data if this is a requirement.

8. _What if my data is sent or stored in the wrong order?_

- If your data is in the wrong order, it is recommended to verify that you are loading the clientside JS correctly. The most effective way to do this is to place a `debugger` call inside the `handleFormSubmit()` function, and, if it hits the debugger and opens the respective Dev Tools for the broswer/environment, then the clientside JS is being loaded correctly. If the debugger isn't hit, then the JS is **not** either not loaded or not targeting your form, defaulting the data to a plain object which will have its own alphabetic ordering instead.
